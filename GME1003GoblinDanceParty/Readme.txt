I did 5 of the 6 steps
I decided to commit/push whenever I finished a step
I executed 8 commit/push
I only had trouble with both GitHub and the assignment at the start but once I got the hang of it, it was ok
I used AI at first when I couldn't figure out how to do the code but it didn't feel right so I got some help and I got rid of the AI stuff
